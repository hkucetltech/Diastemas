# Diastemas
Diastemas project is a web platform that enables participants to create blogs and build communities, with similar features as in many social media websites like Facebook.  The web platform allows participants to collaborate through their participations in peer reviews of their works and group discussions. 

At the moment, the Diastemas is working on the LAMP environment below:
•	Linux:            CentOS 6.7
•	Apache:           Apache 2.4.23
•	MySQL:            Mysql 5.7.16
•	PHP:              PHP 5.6.28

A database schema SQL file named 'diastemas.schema.sql' is included in the source.

To install source code, 

The initial administrator account is 'DPadmin' with password 'DPpassword'.  You are advised to change the password after the installation.
